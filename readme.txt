About:
Our application is written using the Model View Controller pattern, the "Class Diagram" class serves as the model.
It can create and modify "UML diagrams". At this point, you can run the application without a file,
or with the path to your uml diagram file in the command line arguments.
The application will process the file and create the diagram and relationships described in your file.
Unfortunately, our parser does not work perfectly,
so try to follow the syntax as in our example (it is located in the "date" folder).
In our application, you can create a new class, create a connection between them, move classes.
Functions are also available after clicking the right mouse button, such as: Add new attribute, change attribute,
delete attribute, change class name. On the right side of the screen,
information about the class you have selected is available.
Good luck!

You can run jar without file:
cd dest/
java -jar --module-path ../lib/javafx-sdk-11/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.base,javafx.fxml ija-app.jar

Or with path to your diagram:
java -jar --module-path ../lib/javafx-sdk-11/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.base,javafx.fxml ija-app.jar path/to/your/diagram.txt

Run with our file:
